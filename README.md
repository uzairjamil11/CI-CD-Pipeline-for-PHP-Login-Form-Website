  <h1 align="center">CI/CD Pipeline for PHP Login Form Website ðŸ‘‹ </h1>
<p align="center">

This repository contains the necessary files and instructions to set up a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a PHP Login Form website using Docker, Git, GitHub, and Jenkins.

# Project Overview
The project demonstrates the deployment of a PHP Login Form app to AWS EC2 instances, consisting of a master node (Build-In Node) and a deployment server (deployment Node). 
The following DevOps services are utilized:
# Docker: Used to containerize the PHP Apache server and MySQL database.
# Git: Used for version control and collaboration.  
# GitHub: The remote repository where the code is stored.  
# Jenkins: Used for automation, including triggering builds and deployments.  
# Project setup  
To set up the project on an Ubuntu EC2 instance, follow these steps:  
Create an Ubuntu EC2 instance and name it "Build-In Node." Install Java and Jenkins on the instance and connect it with GitHub.  
Push the PHP website code and the docker-compose.yml file to the instance.  
# Update system packages
sudo apt update  
sudo apt upgrade

# Install Java and Jenkins
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y
java --version
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update  
sudo apt-get install jenkins  
jenkins --version

# Create directories for PHP app and MySQL
mkdir php-app mysql

![jenkins](images/directories.png)

# Upload website files and database file using FileZilla or SFTP
# Upload *.php, *.html, *.css, etc. to php-app directory
# Upload *.sql to mysql directory
# Create docker-compose.yml file  
In the docker-compose.yml file, define two services:  
The first service will be responsible handle the MySQL database.  
The second service will be responsible for PHP Apache server.

# initialization of Git repository  
git init  
git add .  
git commit -m "description"  
git branch -M master  
git remote add origin <remote_url>  
git remote add origin https://<AuthorizedToken>@github.com/uzairjamil11/login.git  
git push origin master

Create another Ubuntu EC2 instance and name it "deployment Node." Install Java, Docker, and Docker Compose on this instance.

sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y    
sudo apt install docker.io  
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose    
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose  
docker-compose --version  
Access the Jenkins home page, install recommended plugins, and manage Jenkins nodes and clouds.

 # Jenkins Deployment Node
Open your web browser and navigate to the Jenkins home page.  
Install the recommended plugins.  
Click on "Manage Jenkins" and select "Nodes and Clouds."  
Create a new node named "deployment" with the appropriate settings.  
Connect to the deployment instance via SSH and execute the provided Linux command for connection.

# Create Jenkins Jobs

Create a Jenkins job named "Git-job" to connect with Git and configure it to run automatically in the deployment environment.  
Open the Jenkins web interface and log in.  
Create a new Jenkins job named "Git-job" as a freestyle project.  
Configure the Git repository URL.  
Enable the "GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling" build trigger.  
Enable the "Build after other projects are built" option and add "build-website" as the project to build.  
Restrict the job to run only on the "deployment" environment.  
Configure additional build steps as needed.  
Savethe job configuration.  
Create a Jenkins job named "build-website" and restrict it to run on the "deployment" node.  

![Git](images/jenkins_jobs.jpg)  

Open the Jenkins home page.  
Click on "New Item" to create a new job.  
Enter "build-website" as the name for the job and select the "Freestyle project" option.  
In the job configuration page, restrict the job to run on the "deployment" node.  
Add an "Execute shell" build step with the following commands:  
echo "y" | sudo docker rm -f $(sudo docker ps -a -q)  
sudo docker-compose -f /home/ubuntu/jenkins/workspace/Git-job/docker-compose.yml up -d  
Save the job configuration.

# Set up the CI/CD pipeline.  

Run the "Git-job" first, which will push the code from the GitHub repository to the deployment server.  
Once the "Git-job" completes successfully, the "build-website" job will automatically trigger.  
The "build-website" job will create two Docker container images: one for the Apache and PHP server and another for the MySQL server.  
This ensures that the latest code changes are pushed to the deployment server, and the Docker containers are built and deployed for continuous integration and   continuous deployment.
